# Strings in  python are surrounded by either single or double quotation marks. Let's look at strings formatting and some strings method

name = 'Brad'
age = 37

# Concatenate

# print('Hello, my name is ' + name + ' and I am ' + str(age)) 

# Argument by position

# print('Hello, my name is {name} and I am {age}'.format(name=name, age = age)) 

# F-Strings
print(f'Hello, my name is {name} and I am {age}')  


# Strings formatting

# Strings method

s ='hello world'
#print(s.capitalize())

# Swap case
# print(s.swapcase())

# Replace
# print(s.replace('world', 'everyone'))
